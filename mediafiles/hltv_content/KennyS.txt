We agreed on a lot of conditions, everything went pretty smoothly between them and me," kennyS explained. "The only thing that bothered me is that they re-signed me before benching me. Which makes sense business-wise. It’s pretty smart of them but, obviously, I was not aware. So after like one week or two weeks of signing my new contract, I got benched. Maybe the new contract was too beautiful to be real."

"Unfortunately I’m not only a player who has good performances. I’m also a player with followers and kind of a brand. So the price, even after a year, was still really really high, a price that myself as a businessman would not want to pay for a player that is 27 years old and a player that was showing a bad last year of competition."
