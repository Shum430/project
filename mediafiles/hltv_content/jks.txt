How big of a win was it for you to beat the Major champions in an elimination match here

It's definitely a good win for us because we needed a bit of confidence. We've had a lot of close games against a lot of the top teams, but we just don't manage to close them out. For us to finally push it over the line, it's a good confidence boost. They're a really good team and they play a different style of CS, but we managed to just focus on our own game today and that's a big thing for us, to focus on our own plan and play the way we want to.

Did you notice anything off with Outsiders It was a complete thrashing on Mirage, do you think they're under extra pressure now or something

I'm not really sure of what they were thinking or anything like that, but from our point of view they did similar things as they did in the previous game, so we were comfortable playing against them because we knew how they wanted to play.

In general I think it's not so much about them, we were just more comfortable playing our own game today and not really focusing on what the other team is doing, which works really well for us. I'm not too sure, maybe they just had an off map and we were playing pretty well individually.

You could have won the series against FaZe on Inferno, so you're showed some good Counter-Strike even if you ended up falling in the end. Where's G2 at right now, do you feel like you're able to compete with the best in the world

On a good day we can definitely compete against the best, we can compete against anyone on a good day, but right now we're still sorting out some small details in our game and get everyone on the same page. That stuff takes time, we've only been a team for like four months now, they changed IGL and of course my spot as well, so it's not going to be overnight that we'll just become amazing.
